        <h1>Hello.</h1>
        <p>I'm Yousef Sultan, a Syrian Software Engineer. I've been coding since <strong>4+</strong> years.</p>
        <p>I'm not sure what else I could write here honestly. Maybe read down to see something more interesting.</p>
        <h1>Things I've done</h1>
        <p>I've done few things in the past:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My biggest project is probably <a href="https://codebottle.io/">CodeBottle</a>, a community-powered code sharing website.</li>
            <li>I contributed to the development of <a href="https://vexera.io/">Vexera's website.</a></li>
            <li>I taught and helped many many people coding websites.</li>
            <li>I made few VueJS plugins like <a href="https://github.com/MicroDroid/vue-materialize-datatable">datatables</a> and <a href="https://github.com/MicroDroid/vue-invisible-recaptcha">invisible recaptchas.</a></li>
            <li>Also made browser extensions like <a href="https://github.com/MicroDroid/youtube-download-button">YouTube downloader</a> and <a href="https://github.com/MicroDroid/colext">some weird extension.</a></li>
            <li>I created many many bots on different platforms. (Telegram, Discord, Slack, etc.)</li>
            <li>You can find other nonsense projects at <a href="https://github.com/MicroDroid?tab=repositories">my GitHub.</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are probably not that interesting stuff, but there's a lot of interesting things upcoming.</p>
        <h1>Places I worked at</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Well I only worked at <a href="https://beetronix.com/">Beetronix,</a> a Syrian startup. I am <strong>Full-stack developer</strong> there.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h1>The end</h1>
        <p>Now you reach the end of this very outstanding portfolio.</p>
        <p>Maybe I haven't interested you, but I think you <strong>REALLY</strong> should get in touch with me. I'm really friendly and it'd be nice to meet you. Even if you just want to spam me.</p>
